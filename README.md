This is a choose-your-own-story, text-based game that has been built entirely using the React JavaScript library. The game has been deployed using Netlify, which is a popular web development platform for deploying and hosting web applications.

One of the key features of the game is that it utilizes the useState hook in React to set up the states of the player's choices and carry them forward in their next choices. This means that as the player progresses through the story, their previous choices will be remembered and taken into account in subsequent stages of the game. This is a critical aspect of the game, as it allows for a more immersive and engaging experience for the player, as their choices have a direct impact on the outcome of the story.

The use of React is also significant, as it is a popular and widely-used JavaScript library that is well-suited for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components, which can be easily composed to build complex applications. By using React, the developer has likely been able to create a more streamlined and efficient development process, which has resulted in a more polished and functional end product.

Overall, this project is an exciting example of how modern web development tools and techniques can be used to create engaging and interactive text-based games. By utilizing React and Netlify, the developer has created a game that is both functional and visually appealing, while also incorporating key features that make it a compelling and immersive experience for the player.
