        Zork is an interactive fiction computer game. It was originally
        developed by four members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group—Tim
        Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling–between 1977 and
        1979 for the DEC PDP-10 mainframe computer. The four founded the company
        Infocom in 1979 and released Zork as a commercial game for personal
        computers, split due to memory limits of personal computers compared to
        the mainframe system.

      The three titles released commercially were Zork:
        The Great Underground Empire – Part I in 1980 (later known as Zork I),
        Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz in 1981, and Zork III: The Dungeon Master
        in 1982. The game has since been ported to numerous systems. Zork was
        directly inspired by the first text adventure game, Colossal Cave
        Adventure, written in 1975.

      Zork distinguished itself in its genre as an
        especially rich game, in terms of both the quality of the storytelling
        and the sophistication of its text parser, which was not limited to
        simple verb-noun commands ("hit troll"), but recognized some
        prepositions and conjunctions ("hit the troll with the Elvish sword").
